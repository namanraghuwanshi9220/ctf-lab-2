RootReggie's Quick Note:
Okay, the main access code... I put it somewhere super safe.
Definitely not in /var/www/html/ directly.
Hmm, where did I put that config backup for the 'secret_server_configs'?
I think I backed it up in /opt/... something with 'config_backups'.
Check there for the next piece of the puzzle.
